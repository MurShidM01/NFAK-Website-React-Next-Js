    "tribute": "Today, the world remembers the day it lost a voice that could make the heavens weep.\nUstad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was not just a singer—he was a river of devotion,\nflowing through qawwali, carrying centuries of love, pain, and longing.\n\nHis voice could lift a broken soul,\nturn silence into prayer,\nand make even the stars lean closer to listen.\n\nThough you left this world, Ustad,\nyour notes still breathe in every gathering,\nyour passion still burns in every heart that believes in the power of song.\n\nMay your soul forever rest in the music of the Divine,\nfor you taught us that music is not just to be heard—\nit is to be felt,\ndeep in the place where we meet God.",
